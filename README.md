# Creating and updating the Karmada docs

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Karmada's public website. 
The docs are hosted at https://karmada.io.

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, and
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo
is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content
organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine.
You write the pages in Markdown, and Hugo wraps them up into a website.
